# Attempt to learn ReScript React

This repo is following the tutorial https://github.com/alzateja/react-typescript-rescript-training
In this tutorial it was using reason-react to convert a shopping cart app written in react.

My attempt is to update to newer version using rescript-react to convert this shopping cart app.

# How to run
1. Open a terminal and run:
```npm start
to run webpack in development mode
2. Open another terminal to convert rescript to javascript
```npm run re:watch
