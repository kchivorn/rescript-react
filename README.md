# Attempt to learn ReScript React

This repo is following the tutorial https://github.com/alzateja/react-typescript-rescript-training
In this tutorial it was using reason-react to convert a shopping cart app written in React.

My attempt is to update to a newer version using rescript-react to convert this shopping cart app.

# How to run
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to run webpack in development mode
```
npm start
```

2. Open another terminal to convert ReScript to JavaScript
```
npm run re:watch
```
